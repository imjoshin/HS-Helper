Hearthstone Helper
==================

What is this?
-------------
Hearthstone Helper is a chrome extension created to give players the ability to quickly search for cards and their details.

How does it work?
-----------------
Once the user enters a search parameter, the extension will execute a google image search for the paramter + " hearthstone card" and get the first resulting image.
The info obtained from a search is taken from the assets/cards/ folder. These .json files were generated by server/processJson.php using AllSets.json from [hearthstonejson.com](http://hearthstonejson.com/)

How do I install this extension?
--------------------------------
Download the project using `git clone https://github.com/j0sh77/HS-Helper.git` or downloading the zip [here](https://github.com/j0sh77/HS-Helper/archive/master.zip). Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Google Chrome. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the checkbox in the top right corner. Lastly, click the `Load unpacked extension...` button and select the HS-Helper folder you previously downloaded.
